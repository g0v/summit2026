It also shares ways and templates for initiating civic tech projects and provides case studies to aid readers’ understanding. Finally, this book draws from past experiences from exchanges among various Asian countries, as well as feedback from participants in the Digital Rights Asia-Pacific Assembly 2023 and 2023 FtO Jeju. It shares insights into the regional diversity and differences in East and South Asia, the impact and relationship of governments on civic tech development, and the involvement of young people from Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea in civic tech communities.
