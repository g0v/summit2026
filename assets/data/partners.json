Additionally, the Center seeks to translate traditional academic research results in information law into practical policy language, generating concrete and practical influence on the formulation and implementation of relevant legal and policy frameworks.\nCurrently, the Center plans to address themes including artificial intelligence, information law and regulation, democratic surveillance and governance, health and information, and intellectual property rights. Through explorations and deliberations in the spirit of openness and interdisciplinary connectedness, the Center strives to conduct forward-looking academic research, transform research discussions into popular format, and inform Taiwan’s public on relevant issues related to information law.\nThe Center aspires to be a platform for exchange and interaction among researchers, civil society, and practitioners. Through communication, connection, and discussion among stakeholders, it seeks to balance scientific and technological research and development, industry practices, and legal and ethical norms, enhancing the overall public interest of the society and shaping the future of data-driven democracy."
